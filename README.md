# Server-and-Client-Employee-Manager
This is a program that lets a client search from a "database" (array of employee structs) on our server according to the ID input, and outputs their name and salary from the server.

To run:

1. make
2. >server {port number > 1024}
3. >client {hostname} {port number}
